### This repository contains the analysis scripts and processed data for the manuscript studying the relationship between G-quadruplexes (G4s) and promoter usage.

The `Scripts` folder mainly stores the R codes.

The `Data` folder contains processed RNA-seq, G4, CAGE, and other datasets used in our manuscript. Please note that only processed data are provided; raw data are not included due to their large size. You can download and process the raw data using the methods described in our manuscript (Linux systems are recommended for downloading and processing the raw data).
Additionally, to save storage space, some large files have been processed. Specifically, the file `G4/G4hunter_w25_s1.5.txt.zip` needs to be manually extracted after download, and the GTF file located in `data/ref` must be downloaded by running the provided bash script.
